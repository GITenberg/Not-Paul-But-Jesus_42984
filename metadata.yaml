description: Philosopher and scholar Jeremy Bentham played an important role in the
  early formation of judicial philosophy and philosophy of law. He is also credited
  as playing a key part in the development of the moral philosophy known as utilitarianism,
  in which an action's justness is judged based on its ability to have a positive
  impact on the greatest number of people. Bentham brings both of these domains to
  bear in this fascinating look at the Apostle Paul.
